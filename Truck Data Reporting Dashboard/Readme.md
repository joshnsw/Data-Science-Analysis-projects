<b>Description:</b>
In this project, me and my colleagues collected data from various truck development projects and utilized python machine learning models to create a funding prediction tool. The background of this project was that there was always a variance between budgeting funding of project and actual use of funding. If we are able to create a accurate funding predictor model,resources could be more efficiently utilized by preventing underallocation/overallocation of funding to projects.


<b>What I learnt:</b>

I learnt how to create dashboards for automated reporting/analysis using company data and power BI Tool.
