<b>Description:</b>
The purpose of this project was to automate the powerpoint slides that we have to create for management reporting and to visualise data that we usually receive in excel format. This project solves two problems:

1.In my current job,we have to manually create powerpoint slides for reporting and it can take a considerable amount of time to format and input information into the slides. With a power BI dashboard, we can simply input the key figures into a excel sheet and several dashboards can replace the powerpoint slides,which saves up alot of time. 

2.Additionally, by connecting power BI to a database that we usually get sales figure from, we dont have to make a new request to the database owner each time we require the information, and the data can be shared in an easy to read format.



<b>What I learnt:</b>

I learnt how to create dashboards for automated reporting/analysis using company data and power BI Tool.


<b>Details of the project:</b>

This is the first dashboard that I created,which connects to a database that stores actual sales figure. The information is used to make decisions on which product we should use for further developments.
