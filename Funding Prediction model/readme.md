<b>Description:</b>
In this project, me and my colleagues collected data from various truck projects and utilized python machine learning models to create a funding prediction 
tool. The background of this project was that there was always a variance between budgeting funding of project and actual use of funding. If we are able to create a accurate funding predictor model,resources could be more efficiently utilized by preventing underallocation/overallocation of funding to projects.


<b>What I learnt:</b>

I learnt the process of data science: Data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, model building, results evaluation.


<b>Details of the project:</b>

The steps of the project is as follows:

1. Preliminary data analysis on collected data to find out the top predictors of the target variable.
